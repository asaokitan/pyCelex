pyCelex: a python interface to CELEX2.
======================================

Some code I wrote a while ago for reading stuff, mostly morpho-phonological
data, from CELEX2. Feel free to see if it works for you, fork it, whatever.

Currently hard-coded to read just the English lexicon, but it shouldn't be hard
to parameterize that.
